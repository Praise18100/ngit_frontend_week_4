Digital Professional Bio — Semantic HTML Upgrade

Overview
This project is a refactored version of my Week 2 Bio Page.  
It uses full Semantic HTML5 to improve structure, and SEO performance.

List 3 benefits of using Semantic HTML over generic div tags
1. Improved Accessibility
   Screen readers and assistive technologies can understand the structure of the page better.

2. Better SEO (Search Engine Optimization)
   Search engines like Google understand the meaning of your content, improving ranking and visibility.

3. Cleaner, More Readable Code
   Semantic tags make the layout easier for developers to read, maintain, and collaborate on.
